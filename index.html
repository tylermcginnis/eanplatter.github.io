			<h1>
				WHO I AM
			</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Ean and I am a web developer. I began working in the web almost 2 years ago. At that time I had just begun taking computer science classes, and became enthralled with software development. I loved being able to create clever and entertaining programs, but something was missing.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started to notice software more, and the more I noticed, the more I realized where software should be; online. Web development became an obsession, I loved the ever changing landscape, and the new opportunities that rose up from building software online.

				<h1>Implementation</h1>
				<p>While my skill level in each list above varies, the underlining meaning here is that I am constantly learning. A minimum of 20 hours a week are dedicated to bettering my craft, especially on the fundamentals. For instance, while I am skilled with utilizing Twitter Bootstrap's responsive frameowrk, I spend more time learning how to build responsiveness from the ground up. While I can get deep into manipulating a website with jQuery, I frequently attempt to discover how I can do similar activity with vanilla JavaScript.</p>
